// (child keys win on merge). The authoring surface is the l0169 "builder" idiom:
//   - attribute functions are arity-2 (value, continuation) and merge one key into the
//     continuation record: `attr value cont` -> { ...cont, key: value };
//   - collection builders are arity-2 (list, continuation);
//   - element wrappers are arity-1 (the assembled attribute-chain record).
// A program is one flat chain terminated by a single `{}` at the end.
//
// Enum VALUES (ebsr, character, misreads-detail, rl-1, ...) are bare kebab-case identifiers
// with NO lexicon entries: an undefined identifier resolves to its own lexeme string via
// L0000's IDENT fallback, and composition validates it against the allowed set.
