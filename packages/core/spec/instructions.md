# L0175 Dialect Extensions

_Revised: 2026-06-19_

L0175 composes 5th-grade ELA assessment items (Smarter Balanced · Grade 5 · Claim 1 ·
Reasoning & Evidence) from an authored, inline superset of tagged content. One language serves
**multiple learning targets**; a program selects its target up front.

## Step 0 — pick the learning target

Always declare a top-level `target` (the SBAC learning target the program composes for):

- **`c1-t4`** — Target 4: Reasoning & Evidence over **literary** texts (RL standards). Dimensions:
  `character`, `setting`, `event`, `point-of-view`, `theme`, `topic`, `narrators-feelings`,
  `character-relationship`. Standards: `rl-1` (always) + `rl-3` / `rl-6` / `rl-9`.
- **`c1-t11`** — Target 11: Reasoning & Evidence over **informational** texts (RI standards).
  Dimensions: `relationships-interactions`, `author-use-of-information`, `point-of-view`,
  `purpose`, `authors-opinion`. Standards: `ri-1` (always) + `ri-3` / `ri-6` / `ri-7` / `ri-8` / `ri-9`.
- **`c1-t9`** — Target 9: **Central Ideas** over **informational** texts (RI standards). A
  DIFFERENT skill from Reasoning & Evidence — synthesize and condense: the main/central idea, the
  key details that build it, and summary (NOT inference + justification). Dimensions: `central-idea`,
  `key-detail`, `summary`. Standards: `ri-1` (always) + `ri-2`. **DOK 2** (3 only for the written
  summary). Item types: `multiple-choice`, `multi-select`, `ebsr`, `short-text`, and single-part
  `hot-text` (click the sentence(s) that show the main idea — its directly-supporting `source`s are
  the correct selection). Distractors use a **significance** taxonomy (`too-narrow`,
  `too-broad`, `misreads-detail`, `insignificant`) — usually true statements that just aren't the
  central idea.
- **`c1-t8`** — Target 8: **Key Details** over **informational** texts (RI standards). A DIFFERENT
  model: the inference/conclusion is **GIVEN in the stem**, and the student selects the supporting
  **evidence** (the answer is evidence, not a chosen statement). Dimension: `supporting-evidence`.
  Standards: `ri-1` (always) + `ri-7`. **DOK 1–2**. Item types: `multiple-choice`, `multi-select`,
  `hot-text` (single-part) — no EBSR, no short-text. **Author ONE supported `claim` = the given
  inference (its `focus`), state it in the `stem`, and author `source`s as the options:
  `directly-supports` = correct evidence (with a `quote`), `supports-wrong-claim`/`irrelevant` =
  distractor evidence. No distractor claims.**
- **`c1-t10`** — Target 10: **Word Meanings** over **informational** texts. The MOST different
  model: the question asks for the **meaning of a targeted word/phrase in context**, so the answer
  choices are **meanings**, authored as `word`/`meaning` (not claims). Dimension: `word-meaning`.
  Standards: `ri-4` (always) + the L-4 family by strategy (`l-4a` context, `l-4b` roots/affixes,
  `l-5c` word relationships, `l-4c` reference). **DOK 1–2**. Item types: `multiple-choice`,
  `multi-select`, and `hot-text` (click the word in the excerpt matching a given definition).
  **Author a top-level `words` list: a
  `word` (the targeted word, with `line`/`quote` for context) holding `meanings` — one (MC) or ≥2
  (Multi-Select) `status correct` + `status distractor` meanings (each with a T10 `error-type`
  + `rationale`). The outcome's `focus` names the word; state the word + its context in the `stem`.**

**Infer the target — the user need not state it.** Decide from the passage and the skill asked: a
**literary** text (story/poem/narrative) → `c1-t4`; an **informational** text → an RI target. Among
informational targets, choose by skill: **reasoning** — infer/conclude and justify with evidence
(relationships between ideas, author's use of evidence, point of view/purpose/opinion) → `c1-t11`;
**central ideas** — the main idea, the key details that support it, or a summary → `c1-t9`;
**key details** — the request **states an inference/conclusion and asks which detail/sentence
supports it** (the answer is evidence) → `c1-t8`; **word meanings** — the request asks **what a
word/phrase means in context** → `c1-t10`. The skill also signals T4: character / theme /
narrator's point of view. When the text type is genuinely ambiguous, prefer `c1-t4`; for an
informational request, match the verbs: "infer/conclude/why" → T11; "main idea/summarize/most
about" → T9; "which detail/sentence supports [this stated idea]" → T8; "what does [word] mean" → T10.
Write the choice as the first top-level form: `target c1-t11`. Use the dimensions, standards, and
stem catalog (in `stems.md`) for that target; mixing targets' vocabularies is a compile error,
and the passage `type` should match the target (literary for T4; informational for T11 and T9). If
`target` is omitted entirely the compiler defaults to `c1-t4` and warns — so always emit one
explicitly rather than relying on the default.

## Authoring contract

**Compose questions first (item-first).** After picking the target, author the N `outcome`s you
want — each with a unique `id`, a `focus` naming its correct claim, and an explicit `stem` (and
`stem-b` on EBSR) taken from the target's section of the Appropriate-Stem catalog (`stems.md`).
THEN author the supported claims each `focus` names, and a superset of distractor claims, each
tagged with `targets` listing the question id(s) it foils. The compiler draws an item's foils
ONLY from the distractors that target that outcome — so every wrong answer is authored against
that exact stem and key.

A program is ONE flat builder chain ending in a single `{}..`. Top-level forms
(`target`, `passage`, `type`, `lines`, `claims`, `evidence`, `outcomes`) chain with no `{}`
between them. Inside the `claims` / `evidence` / `outcomes` lists, each element (`claim` /
`source` / `outcome`) is its own attribute chain terminated by its own `{}`; whitespace separates
elements (commas are optional).

Quote free text (`text`, `rationale`, `subject`, passage heading) and id labels (`id`,
`cites`, `supports`). Write closed-enum values as bare kebab-case identifiers (`c1-t4`, `ebsr`,
`character`, `misreads-detail`, `directly-supports`, `rl-1`, `r-dok3`).

## Forms and attributes

- **target** `c1-t4` | `c1-t11` — top level; selects the learning-target profile (dimensions,
  standards, stem catalog). Always author one; if omitted, the compiler defaults to `c1-t4`.
- **grade** `<n>` — optional, top level (e.g. `grade 5`). The reading-level target the compiler
  checks the passage against. Defaults to the guideline/target's grade (5 for `c1-t4`/`c1-t11`);
  author one only to override when the user's prompt asks for a different grade.
- **passage** `"heading"` — plus `type` (`literary` | `informational`) and
  `lines [ "..." ... ]`. **By default each entry is one PARAGRAPH of the passage**, auto-numbered
  from 1 (so the passage shows numbered paragraphs, matching SBAC). **Preserve the paragraph breaks
  the request supplies** — emit one `lines` entry per source paragraph; do not merge the passage
  into a single entry or re-chunk it. Split by paragraph for **every** task model, including Hot
  Text: the compiler segments each paragraph into sentences and makes each sentence individually
  selectable in Hot Text Part B, so the passage keeps its paragraph layout — do **not** author the
  passage as one sentence per line.
- **claim** — `id`, `status` (`supported` | `distractor`), `dimension` (required on supported
  claims), `text`. A `distractor` also requires `error-type`, a non-empty `rationale`, and
  `targets` (the outcome id(s) of the question(s) it foils). Optional: `cites` (evidence ids),
  `subject`, `standard`, `dok`, and `plausibility` (a 0–1 override for how tempting a distractor
  is — otherwise the compiler computes it from evidence overlap, structure, and error type when
  choosing among the foils of the same error type that target the outcome).
- **source** — `id`, `line` (the numbered passage entry — a paragraph by default) or `quote`,
  `status` (`directly-supports` | `supports-wrong-claim` | `irrelevant`), `supports` (claim ids).
  Optional `rationale` explaining a foil. **For EBSR Part B, give the source a `quote` with the
  exact supporting SENTENCE** while `line` points at the paragraph that contains it — so Part B
  options stay tight sentences even though the passage is numbered by paragraph. (Without `quote`,
  the option text is the whole paragraph at `line`.)
- **outcome** — `id` (required, unique — distractors target it), `type`
  (`ebsr` | `hot-text` | `short-text` | `multiple-choice` | `multi-select`), `dimension`, `focus`
  (required — the id of the supported correct claim; on `multi-select` a **list** of ids = the
  correct set), `stem` (required — the Part A / single-question stem / short-text prompt, authored
  from `stems.md`), and on EBSR `stem-b` (required — the Part B stem). Optional: `subject`,
  `standard`, `dok`, and `rubric` (short-text only — a list of `band score <n> descriptor "…"`
  elements; defaults to a 0/1/2 rubric if omitted).
- **band** — a rubric row: `band score 2 descriptor "…" {}`. Used only inside an outcome's `rubric`.
- **word** / **meaning** (**target `c1-t10` only**) — a top-level `words` list of `word`s; each
  `word` has `id`, `text` (the targeted word/phrase), optional `line`/`quote` (its context), and a
  `meanings` list. A `meaning` has `id`, `text` (the definition/synonym), `status`
  (`correct` | `distractor`), and on a distractor an `error-type` (`other-meaning` | `misinterprets`
  | `wrong-context`) + `rationale`. The outcome's `focus` names the `word`; its correct meaning(s)
  are the key, the distractor meanings the foils. Example:
  `words [ word id "w1" text "aqueduct" line 1 quote "The aqueduct carried water." meanings [ meaning id "m1" status correct text "a water channel" {} meaning id "m2" status distractor error-type other-meaning text "a boat" rationale "another meaning, ignores context" {} ] {} ]`
  For a **click-the-word** (`hot-text`) item, author the focus `word` (the correct one) as the
  outcome's `focus` with the `line` of its paragraph, then the **distractor candidate words** either
  (a) as more single-word `word`s in the list, or (b) as the focus word's distractor `meanings`
  whose `text` IS the candidate word (a single word, with error-type + rationale) — for hot-text the
  meaning text must be the literal word to click, not a definition. **All candidates must be words
  that appear in that one paragraph.** The compiler shows the paragraph and makes the candidate words
  clickable, with the focus word correct. The `stem` is just the instruction + definition — do
  **not** paste the paragraph into it (the compiler warns if you do). ⚠ If you author *only* the
  focus word with a real multi-word definition (no candidate words), the compiler falls back to
  making **every** content word clickable — list the candidate words to avoid that. Candidates not
  in the focus word's paragraph are warned and dropped.
- A top-level **`title`** attribute (before `passage`) names the assessment; it is echoed on the output.

## Stems (Appropriate Stems, SBAC G5 · C1 · T4)

**You author the stem; the compiler does not generate it. Use the guideline's Appropriate-Stem
templates verbatim — do not invent phrasings.** For each item, open the catalog in **`stems.md`**,
pick the one template that matches the item type (EBSR → Task Model 1, Hot Text → Task Model 2,
Short Text → Task Model 3) and the task (inference vs. conclusion vs. author-intent; plain
subject vs. narrator's-feelings vs. relationship), and fill its bracketed `[...]` slot. Author
`stem` (Part A / short-text prompt) and, on EBSR, `stem-b` (Part B). Common Part A choices:

- inference — "Which of these inferences about [...] is supported by the passage?"
- conclusion — "Which of these conclusions about [...] is supported by the passage?"
- author-intent — "What did the author most likely mean by including [...] in the passage?"

**Specificity rule (required).** Fill the `[...]` slot — the guideline's
`[provide character's name / setting / event / author's point of view / theme / topic]` slot —
with the **specific** reference the question is about, the same string you put in `subject`:
`character`→ the character's name (`"Mother"`); `point-of-view`→ `"the narrator's point of view"`;
`setting` / `event` / `theme` / `topic`→ the specific setting/event/theme/topic;
`narrators-feelings`→ "the narrator's feelings toward {subject}"; `character-relationship`→
"{subject}'s relationship with {other}". Do **not** leave it generic (`"the character"`) and do
**not** pad it — write `"the theme"`, not `"the theme of the passage"` (the stem already ends
"…supported by the passage"). A specific subject is what makes the four answer choices
discriminating. Hot Text uses the "Click on the statement…" forms; Short Text ends with
"Explain using key details from the passage to support your answer."

**Hot Text Part A asks for the best STATEMENT — never for passage sentences.** The Part A `stem`
must be a Task Model 2 "Click on the statement that best provides an inference/conclusion about
[...]" prompt whose four options are inference `claim`s. Selecting the supporting sentences is
**Part B**, which the compiler fixes automatically — you never author it. **Translate a request
that says "select/click the sentences that show [X]"**: that phrasing describes the *Part B*
target, not the Part A stem. Author Part A as "Click on the statement that best provides an
inference about [X] that is supported by the passage." (a statement about [X]), make the correct
`claim` that inference, and mark the sentences that show [X] as `directly-supports` evidence with
exact `quote`s — those become Part B's correct selections. Do **not** copy "select the sentences
that…" into the `stem`. The compiler warns ("Hot Text Part A must ask for the best STATEMENT…")
when a Hot Text Part A stem mentions sentences.

The concrete answer and its foils are authored as `claim`s (the correct claim, named by the
outcome's `focus`, states the inferred fact, e.g. "Cortez is about twelve"; its foils `targets`
the outcome). Remember the answer must be **inferable from evidence** (Target 4) — a fact stated
outright is literal recall and out of scope.

## Authoring guidance

- For each EBSR/Hot-Text outcome, author **at least 5 viable distractor claims that `targets`
  it**, covering all three error types (`misreads-detail`, `erroneous-inference`,
  `faulty-reasoning`) — with ≥2 alternatives in at least two of the types. An item draws only 3
  foils, so a deeper targeted pool gives selection real choice. **Fewer than 3 targeted foils is
  a hard error** (the item can't be composed); fewer than 5 triggers a composition warning.
- A distractor may `targets` more than one question when it genuinely foils each (e.g. several
  items built around the same correct claim). Keep foils written to the specific stem + key they
  target — that is the whole point of binding by `targets` rather than by dimension.
- **Over-generate: aim for 5–8 distinct distractors per question** (some will be filtered as
  near-duplicates or accidentally correct), spanning a spread of difficulty, and give each a
  `plausibility` score (0–1) for how tempting it is to a partial-understander. Composition selects
  the most plausible foil per error type from this scored pool; if a score is omitted the compiler
  computes one from the inference graph (evidence overlap, structure, error type).
- Tag evidence so Part B has material: mark the sources that **directly support** the correct
  claim, and author **at least 5 non-supporting foil sources** — `supports-wrong-claim` sources
  plus `irrelevant` sources. EBSR Part B draws 3 foils + the correct source; a pool of ≥5 lets the
  compiler pick the most tempting 3. Fewer than 5 triggers a composition warning. Give each EBSR
  Part B source a `quote` with the exact supporting **sentence** (and a `line` pointing at its
  paragraph), so the four Part B options are tight sentences rather than whole paragraphs.
- **Hot Text Part B selects sentences, not paragraphs.** Keep the passage split by paragraph; the
  compiler segments each paragraph into sentences and exposes every sentence as a selectable Part B
  option, preserving the paragraph layout. Mark the correct sentence(s) by giving each
  `directly-supports` source a `quote` with the exact supporting **sentence** (and a `line` at its
  paragraph). A `directly-supports` source with no `quote` marks every sentence of its `line`
  correct.
- **Hot Text Part B asks for an EXACT number of sentences from a SUPERSET of valid answers.** The
  valid (directly-supporting) sentences are a superset; the student must select a specific count,
  and **any selection of that many drawn from the valid set is correct** — they never have to find
  every one. The compiler sets the count to **one less than the valid count** (a proper subset),
  floored at 1 (one valid sentence) and capped at 3 (so it stays ≤3 once there are more than 4
  valid): `count = min(3, validCount − 1)`, or 1 when `validCount ≤ 1`. It writes the matching
  "Click N sentence(s)…" instruction. **Author a real superset: mark every sentence that genuinely
  supports the inference as a `directly-supports` source with an exact `quote` — aim for ≥3 so the
  asked count is ≥2 and there's real choice.** With only one valid sentence the compiler warns and
  the answer is that single sentence.
- **No-giveaway rule (EBSR Part B): for every EBSR question, author at least one
  `supports-wrong-claim` line whose `supports` lists BOTH the correct claim's id AND a
  distractor's id** — a passage line that *seems* to back the correct inference but actually
  props up a misreading. Part B asks "which line supports your Part A answer?"; if none of the
  Part B foils also point at the correct claim, the correct line is the only one "about" the
  right answer, so a student can back into Part A from the evidence (and the compiler warns
  "possible A↔B giveaway"). Tie the shared line to a distractor you expect Part A to use, so it
  is selected as a Part B foil. Do **not** make every `supports-wrong-claim` line point only at
  distractors — that is exactly what triggers the warning.
  Example: `source id "e2" line 2 status supports-wrong-claim supports ["c1" "c2"] {}` — `c1` is
  the correct claim, `c2` one of its foils; this line tempts in both Part A and Part B.
- **Length-balance rule (no length giveaway): keep the correct claim's `text` parallel in
  length and detail to its distractors.** A frequent tell is the key being the longest, most
  qualified, most-detailed option — a partial-understander learns to pick "the long one." Write
  the correct claim as tersely as it can be stated, and give the foils comparable specificity
  (similar clause count and roughly the same length) rather than short, flat statements. The same
  applies to the EBSR Part B `quote`s — pick supporting and non-supporting sentences of similar
  length. The compiler flags a "possible length giveaway" warning when the correct option is the
  longest AND notably longer than the average distractor; treat that warning as a cue to pad the
  foils or trim the key.
- **Stem-wording rule (no answer echo): the Part A stem must not reuse the correct option's
  wording.** Keep the stem a neutral question that names only the subject/skill (fill the catalog
  template's `[...]` slot with the subject, e.g. "the narrator's point of view" or "how the city's
  systems helped people") — do **not** restate the correct claim's phrasing in the stem. If the
  stem already contains the answer's distinctive words ("...that best show that the city *had
  systems that helped people move around the city and get fresh water*", when the key says the
  city "*had built systems … that let people move through the city and get fresh water*"), the
  answer is obvious without reading the options. **Paraphrase** so the stem and the key share only
  the subject, and word the correct option in the passage's own terms. This applies to **every
  Hot Text and EBSR question, across all targets**. The compiler warns ("Part A: the stem reuses
  much of the correct option's wording …") when the stem reuses most of the key's content words —
  treat it as a cue to reword the stem.
- **Grade-appropriate text complexity: author the passage AND all question text at the target
  grade.** The grade is the guideline/target's grade (Grade 5 for `c1-t4`/`c1-t11`) unless the
  user asks for another, in which case set a top-level `grade <n>`. At the Grade-5 instance:
  reading level near the CCSS grade-4–5 band (Lexile ≈ 740–1010L, Flesch–Kincaid grade ≈ 4.5–6.0);
  sentences mostly simple/compound, averaging ~12–16 words; concrete, high-frequency vocabulary
  with at most a few context-clear Tier-2 words (avoid abstract/academic Tier-3 diction); a single
  passage ≈ 150–350 words; figurative language sparing and accessible. **The reasoning must be
  grade-level too:** DOK 3 means strategic thinking *within* grade-level text, so the correct
  inference comes from concrete textual details — what a character does or says, a stated cause and
  effect — not college-style thematic or authorial-technique analysis. Keep distractor, option, and
  rationale text in the same register as the passage; a wrong answer that reads more academic than
  the text gives itself away. The compiler estimates the passage's reading level and warns when it
  runs above the target grade — treat that warning as a cue to shorten sentences and simplify
  vocabulary. Scale the figures with the grade for non-Grade-5 targets.
- Distractor rationales must state *why a student would plausibly choose the foil* (the error
  it targets). They appear in the item's `distractorAnalysis` output.
- The same passage + superset can drive several outcomes; add one `outcome` per item you want.

## Built-in enumerations

- `target`: `c1-t4`, `c1-t11`, `c1-t9`, `c1-t8`, `c1-t10` (top level; always author one — defaults to `c1-t4` if omitted)
- `grade`: a number (top level, optional; defaults to the target's grade — 5 for all current targets)
- item `type`: `ebsr`, `hot-text`, `short-text`, `multiple-choice`, `multi-select` · passage `type`: `literary`, `informational`
  (allowed per target — T4/T11: ebsr/hot-text/short-text · T9: multiple-choice/multi-select/ebsr/hot-text/short-text · T8: multiple-choice/multi-select/hot-text · T10: multiple-choice/multi-select/hot-text)
- `dimension` (**c1-t4**): `character`, `setting`, `event`, `point-of-view`, `theme`, `topic`, `narrators-feelings`, `character-relationship`
- `dimension` (**c1-t11**): `relationships-interactions`, `author-use-of-information`, `point-of-view`, `purpose`, `authors-opinion`
- `dimension` (**c1-t9**): `central-idea`, `key-detail`, `summary` · (**c1-t8**): `supporting-evidence` · (**c1-t10**): `word-meaning`
- claim `status`: `supported`, `distractor` · source `status`: `directly-supports`, `supports-wrong-claim`, `irrelevant` · meaning `status` (c1-t10): `correct`, `distractor`
- `error-type` (**c1-t4 / c1-t11**): `misreads-detail`, `erroneous-inference`, `faulty-reasoning` · (**c1-t9**): `too-narrow`, `too-broad`, `misreads-detail`, `insignificant` · (**c1-t8**): none — wrong answers are non-supporting `source`s · (**c1-t10**): `other-meaning`, `misinterprets`, `wrong-context`
- `standard` (**c1-t4**): `rl-1`, `rl-3`, `rl-6`, `rl-9` · (**c1-t11**): `ri-1`, `ri-3`, `ri-6`, `ri-7`, `ri-8`, `ri-9` · (**c1-t9**): `ri-1`, `ri-2` · (**c1-t8**): `ri-1`, `ri-7` · (**c1-t10**): `ri-4`, `l-4`, `l-4a`, `l-4b`, `l-4c`, `l-5c`
- `dok`: `r-dok1`, `r-dok2`, `r-dok3` (R&E items are `r-dok3`; T9 selected-response is `r-dok2`, its written summary `r-dok3`; T8 & T10 are `r-dok2`)

## What composition does

For each outcome the compiler takes the correct claim named by `focus`, draws that outcome's
foils from the distractors that `targets` it (selecting for error-type coverage and
plausibility), uses the authored `stem`/`stem-b`, builds the task-model item, and emits
`distractorAnalysis` (every foil's error type + rationale + the claim it ties to), an
`answerKey`, the matched `standards` and `dok`, and `warnings` when the targeted pool is thin.
It never generates content or stems — author them.
